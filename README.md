## Branching Notes

This will list ways to create and manage branches.

'git branch'

Lists all branches you have locally, and highlights the one you're in.

'git branch branchName'

Create a new branch named branchName.

'git checkout -b branchName'

Before you intend to merge a branch, pull from 'master' locally.

Make sure you pull from 'origin master' locally after you've merged on GitHub otherwise local master will be old master.
